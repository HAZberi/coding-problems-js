# GRAPHS DATA STRUCTURE

- In Graphs, there are _vertices/nodes_ which contains data, _vertices/nodes_ are connected with _edges_ to form a network.
- Graphs are basically a superset of Trees and LinkList or any DS(Data Structure) with connected nodes.
- Any kind of network is basically a form of Graphs.

## Types of Graphs

### Directed Graph

    Direction pointer is known and nodes can only be accessed in a specified direction. Example: One-way streets in Downtown core.

### Undirected Graph

    There is no pointer direction and nodes are connected in a bi-directional Manner. Example: Highway between two cities.

### Weighted Graph

    In weighted graphs edges have priority weight. Example: Shortest path to the destination, where length of the road is priority between nodes.

### Unweighted Graph

    Unweighted graphs does not have any priority weight asscociated with edges.

### Cyclic Graph

    A cyclic graph is one where it is possible to return back to the starting node. Example: Node traversal can complete a cycle.

### Acyclic Graph

    An Acyclic graph is the one where it is impossible to return back to the starting node. Example: Node traversal can not complete a cycle.

*Note: Graphs usually exist in a combination of types defined above.*
