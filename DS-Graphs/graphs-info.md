# GRAPHS DATA STRUCTURE

- In Graphs, there are vertices/nodes which contains data, vertices/nodes are connected with edges to form a network.
- Graphs are basically a superset of Trees and LinkList or any DS(Data Structure) with connected nodes.
- Any kind of network is basically a form of Graphs.

## Types of Graphs

### Directed Graph

### Undirected Graph

### Weighted Graph

### Unweighted Graph

### Cyclic Graph

### Acyclic Graph

*Note: Graphs usually exist in a combination of types defined above*
