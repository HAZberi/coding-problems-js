## Dynamic Programming

- Dynamic programming is all about caching. 
- Caching is basically a way to store the solution of commonly occuring problems and use them instantly whenever these problems arise. 
- Caching results or solutions make a huge impact on performance. Although there has to be some sort of temporary or permanent space/memory for caching.
- Example: A database retrieval can be made faster using Redis caching. 

### Generic Steps that lead to Dynamic Programming

- A problem can be divided into sub problems. 
- Try implementing a recursive solution. 
- Ask if there are any repetitive sub problems in finding the final solution. _Recursive or not_
- Memoize subproblems.
- Ask a raise from your boss. Easy. 😁 😁 😁
