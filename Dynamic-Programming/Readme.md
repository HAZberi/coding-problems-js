## Dynamic Programming

- Dynamic programming is all about caching. 
- Caching is basically a way to store the solution of commonly occuring problems and use them instantly whenever these problems arise. 
- Caching results or solutions make a huge impact on performance. Although there has to be some sort of temporary or permanent space/memory for caching.
- Example: A database retrieval can be made faster using Redis caching.
