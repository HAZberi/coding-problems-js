Binary Search Trees Pointers!!

- A node in the tree represents a value, a pointer to the left node and a pointer to the right node.
class Node {
    constructor(value){
        this.value = value;
        this.left = null;
        this.right = null;
    }
}

- BigO => log n

Perfect Binary Tree:
    A tree that doesnt have a parent with only one child. This tree has all the parents with 
    either two or zero children.
    Leaf nodes/Terminating nodes contain half + 1 of all the nodes in the tree. Thats why is 
    super effecient to store data in a Perfect Binary Tree.
    BigO is usually is a factor of log n.
