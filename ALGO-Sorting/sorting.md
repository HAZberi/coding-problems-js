## Sorting Data

- Sorting is one of the most important topics in computer science, since it has a direct effect on performance and efficiency.
- Larger programs and data intensive applications need better and better sorting algorithms.
- Big companies like FAANG put huge emphasis on efficient sorting mechanisms.
- Better sorting techniques are a must for scalablity.
- Sorting is a very important topic for coding interviews.
- Language native `sort()` methods depends on the implementation and might not provide an optimal solution.
